# ECECapstoneProject
**Remote Wireless Penetration Testing with LoRa-Controlled Rover**

This repository contains the full source code and documentation for our ECE SP-53 Capstone Project at Rutgers University. The project showcases a modular, unmanned wireless penetration testing system that uses LoRa communication to control a rover capable of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth security assessments in hard-to-reach or infrastructure-limited environments.

The platform supports long-range encrypted control, image capture, remote packet injection, and scripted penetration testing ‚Äî all operable over a custom communication protocol optimized for high-latency, low-bandwidth conditions.
